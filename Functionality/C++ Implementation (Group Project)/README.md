The project was split into two portions, a group implementation of the base game rules, and an indivdual component of additional features.
Included in this file is a report which contains the group project, as well as my individual features added. Names have been redacted from the report, as well as the individual components of each of the other members.

Also in this file contains my individual contributions to this project, both the group and individual components. The full implementation is not included in this repository, only my contribtions, please see the report for the full list of components and relevant dependancies. You can find c++ and header files contributed by me in the Individual Contributions file.
