# Level Design
In this project I was tasked with designing a level using the Mega Man Maker Software. 
I was given a two word prompt as a starting off point, and had to use the assets in the software to design a level that fit that theme.
In this folder you can find:
- An mmlv file with my designed level which can be played in the Mega Man Maker Software (Not Provided)
- My Designer's Statement, which goes into more detail about the thought process that went into creating this level.

Below is a Vimeo Link where I play through the level in its entirety. <br />

I enjoyed the design elements of this subject and this project, taking a step back from the techincal majority of my course was a welcome change.
I received high marks for this assignment, with the following comment:
"Unfortunately, this is basically a perfect level. I am stumped as to what kind of feedback I can give you other than "yeah it's good" which is a bit of a problem because it's my job to find things to critique. The best I can come up with is that maybe the final boss room could have been a little more visually interesting, but even then, it stood out because of its sparseness, and felt like a callback to the previous red platform section in a way that felt appropriate and narratively coherent. You have done a really excellent job here and should be very proud. I look forward to seeing more."
