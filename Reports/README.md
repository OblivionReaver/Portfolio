# Reports
In this folder you can find a number of reports written by myself as a discussion of different theoretical, as well as cultural and ethical topics relevant to modern technology.

## Games Studies
In this study, we looked at different cultural and ethical practices portrayed in video games, such as Violence, Gender, etc. 
Then, as independent work, we were tasked with exploring one of these practices (not already discussed in class), using one game as a case study.
I chose to explore race and culture identity, using World of Warcraft as a backdrop for my discussion

## Machine Learning
In this course, we were tasked with automating task analysis of different datasets. We were tasked with organising data and trends, and then feeding them through an Machine Learning algorithim to predict future trends.
This report contains an analysis and discussion of the dataset, as well as the actual training of the algorithim, rather than the actual predictions themselves.

## Games and AI Techniques (Group Project)
In this course, as part of a group project, we were charged with training an AI model to complete some task, with this case being, navigating a maze like environment to reach some goal.
While our group trained using different methods, we collectively came together to write this report, with my functional contribution is included and discussed in section 4.8 - 4.10. A final analysis in our report was also written by myslef.
NOTE: Names of group members are redacted on the front page.
